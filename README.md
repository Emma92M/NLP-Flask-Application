# Flask NLP Web Application

## Overview
This Flask-based web application provides various Natural Language Processing (NLP) services. It integrates Python libraries such as spaCy, transformers, sklearn, nltk, and gensim to offer text summarization, feature extraction, entity recognition, LDA clustering, and semantic similarity analysis.

## Features
1. **Text Summarization**: Implements the BART model from Hugging Face's transformers to summarize text.
2. **Feature Extraction and Entity Recognition**: Utilizes spaCy for entity recognition and sklearn's TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.
3. **LDA Clustering**: Applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling on summarized text.
4. **Semantic Similarity Analysis**: Computes semantic similarity between sentences using cosine similarity on vectors generated by spaCy.

## Installation

1. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Dependencies**: Install all necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install flask spacy transformers sklearn nltk gensim
   ```
3. **Additional Models**: Download the required spaCy and transformers models:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Application**: Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
2. **Accessing the Endpoints**: The application offers several endpoints:
   - Home (`/`): Displays the homepage.
   - Summarize Text (`/summarize`): POST endpoint for text summarization.
   - Extract Features and Entities (`/extract`): POST endpoint for feature extraction and entity recognition.
   - LDA Clustering (`/lda`): POST endpoint for LDA clustering.
   - Semantic Similarity Analysis (`/semantic_similarity`): POST endpoint for semantic similarity analysis.
